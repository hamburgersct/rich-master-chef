## Introduction

We find that cooking is quite fun. So, we get our inspiration from food booths (such as taco booths, sushi shops) for our project.

This is a restaurant simulation game based on the brick library to provide users with an immerse and interesting cooking experience. Players are provided an initial budget for a day, which they can use to purchase different ingredients (for dishes). After that, they will use ingredients to cook dishes based on their recipes. Different recipes (a.k.a., combinations of ingredients) consume different time and could sell at different prices. Player who earns the most at the end of several days wins the game. Players must maximize the utilization of their budget and make the best profit by using the least amount of time. At the same time, players have to make sure they are taking care of whatâ€™s happening in the kitchen, because mistakes happen at times. In this case, players need to handle these events in a timely manner.
